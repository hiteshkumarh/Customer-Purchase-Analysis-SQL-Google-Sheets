# Customer Purchase Analysis (SQL-Google-Sheets)üìä

This project involved designing and executing a comprehensive data analysis pipeline to derive key business insights from a customer purchase dataset. Using SQL, I performed data manipulation and aggregation to calculate critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and identify sales trends. The results were then exported and visualized in an interactive Google Sheets dashboard to provide a clear, high-level overview of customer behavior.

Key Highlights & Business Insights üí°

Total Sales & Customer Metrics: Calculated total sales ($6,357,337) and the total number of customers (10). The average order value was found to be $334,596.68. This initial analysis provides a baseline for evaluating overall business performance.



Top Customers: Identified the top five customers by total spend , with 

C043 and C021 being the highest spenders. This insight is valuable for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.


Category Performance: Analyzed the distribution of sales across different product categories. 

Electronics accounted for the largest share of total units sold at 30.4% , followed by 

Sports at 19.3% and 

Clothing at 18.6%. This data helps inform inventory management and marketing efforts.


Sales Trends: Visualized monthly sales to identify seasonal patterns and trends. The analysis shows a significant peak in sales around July 2023, followed by a decline and another peak in mid-2024. Understanding these trends is crucial for forecasting and resource planning.




Customer Segmentation: Classified customers as "above average" or "below average" spenders to identify high-value clients. This segmentation allows for the development of personalized engagement strategies.

Technical Skills Demonstrated üíª
SQL: Wrote and executed complex queries to aggregate data, calculate KPIs, and join tables. This showcases proficiency in data manipulation and extraction.

Data Visualization: Built a multi-panel, interactive dashboard in Google Sheets, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into clear, actionable visual insights.

Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key trends, top performers, and anomalies within the dataset.

Project Management: Managed the entire data analysis lifecycle, from initial query design to final dashboard creation, proving end-to-end project ownership.

How to View the Dashboard üëÅÔ∏è
The project's visualizations are presented in the included PDF file named Dasboard - Dashboard (1).pdf. This document showcases the output of the SQL queries, including charts for monthly sales trends, customer spending analysis, and product category performance.
